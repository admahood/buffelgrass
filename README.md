# Data and code for: Buffelgrass (*Pennisetum ciliare*) invasion reduces plant diversity and influences carbon pools in the southwestern U.S.

Buffelgrass (Pennisetum ciliare) is a perennial bunchgrass, invasive in arid ecosystems of the United States, Australia, and Mexico. Buffelgrass invasion detrimentally affects ecosystems, but it is unclear how the amount of invasion (i.e., buffelgrass percent cover) affects ecological impact. Here, we investigated the impacts of buffelgrass invasion on: plant diversity, aboveground biomass carbon, and surface soil (0-10 cm) carbon. We established 13 plots in areas without evidence of recent fire, across a range of buffelgrass cover (0-68%) in the Sonoran Desert of Arizona, USA. Shannon diversity significantly decreased with buffelgrass cover (p<0.001). Herbaceous carbon storage significantly increased with buffelgrass cover (p<0.01). There was a significant non-linear relationship between woody carbon storage and buffelgrass cover (p<0.05), with high values at intermediate buffelgrass cover. There were also positive associations in occurrence between buffelgrass and many woody plant species. This may indicate facilitation of buffelgrass establishment by woody plants, or that buffelgrass does not competitively exclude shrubs and cacti until high cover is reached, or following fire. Total soil carbon content in surface soils was significantly lower below buffelgrass and bare ground compared to native vegetation (p<0.01) though did not vary significantly across the gradient of invasion, in the absence of fire. Because diversity metrics decreased linearly with buffelgrass cover, management strategies that reduce buffelgrass cover may still have positive ecological outcomes even if eradication cannot be achieved. This study clearly demonstrates the substantial impact of buffelgrass invasion on arid ecosystem structure and function.
